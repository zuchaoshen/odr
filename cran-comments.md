## Resubmission

This is for updating the package. In this version, we added new functions to 
identify the optimal sample allocation in single-level experiments
investigating mediation effects, and perform power analysis for such designs.

Across operational systems we tested, there are four notes that can be ignored (detailed below).

Please help process this package at your convenience! Thanks a lot! 

## Test environments
* local Windows 11, R 4.2.3
* r-hub
* win-builder (devel and release)
