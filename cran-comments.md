## Resubmission

This is for updating the package. In this version, we added the ant colony 
optimization algorithm to identify optimal sample allocations for od.2m and 
od.3m functions. We also added functions to identify sample allocations for 
experiments investigating mediation and moderation effects.

Across operational systems we tested, there are two notes that 
can be ignored (detailed below).

Please help process this package at your convenience! Thanks a lot!
