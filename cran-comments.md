## Resubmission

This is for updating the package. In this version, we added a couple of functions
(od.2m.only.mod, od.2m.mod, power.2m.mod) for identifying the (jointly) optimal
sample allocation for moderation (and main) effects in two-level multisite
randomized trials.

Across operational systems we tested, there are no issues (no notes or warnings).

Please help process this package at your convenience! Thanks a lot!
