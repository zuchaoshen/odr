# Updates (version 1.4.2)
## New features
Updated the package description/title and updated arguments and solutions for the function of power.1.111.


# Updates (version 1.4.1)
## New features
Added functions od.1.111 and power.1.111, for optimal design and statistical power of single-level randomized controlled trials probing mediation effects under the Sobel test and the joint significance test.

# Updates (version 1.3.1)
## New features
- Fixed some bugs, this version allows ICCs and R-squared to be 0 or 1.



# Updates (version 1.2.1)
## New features
- Added functions od.2.221 and power.2.221, for optimal design and statistical power of two-level cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) probing mediation effects with cluster-level mediators under the Sobel test and joint significance test across different optimization methods (partial derivative, ant colony optimization).

# Updates (version 1.0.2)
- update references
- update documentation for these functions

# Updates (version 1.0.0)
- Added functions (od.1 and power.1) for individual randomized controlled trials 
- Added functions (od.2m and power.2m) for two-level multisite randomized trials 
- Added functions (od.3m and power.3m) for three-level multisite randomized trials 
- Added functions (od.4m and power.4m) for four-level multisite randomized trials 
- Updated function 're' to include all the seven types of trials

# Updates (version 0.7.3)
- Added function 're' to calculate relative efficiency of two studies
- Added functions (od.3 and power.3) for three-level cluster randomized trials 
- Added functions (od.4 and power.4) for four-level cluster randomized trials 
- Changed license from GPL-2 to GPL-3
- Added variance of treatment effect to output in 'od' functions
- Added required sample size to the output in required budget calculation in 'power' functions 

# Initial release of odr (version 0.3.2)
- Optimal design and statistical power for two-level group randomized trials.
