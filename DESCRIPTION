Description: Calculate the optimal sample size allocation that 
    produces the highest statistical power for experimental 
    studies under a budget constraint, and
    perform power analyses with and without accommodating 
    cost structures of sampling. The designs cover single-level 
    and multilevel experiments detecting main, mediation, 
    and moderation effects (and some combinations).
