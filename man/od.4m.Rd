\value{
Unconstrained or constrained optimal sample allocation
    (\code{n}, \code{J}, \code{K}, and \code{p}).
    The function also returns the variance of the treatment effect,
    function name, design type,
    and parameters used in the calculation.
}
\description{
The optimal design of four-level
    multisite randomized trials (MRTs) is to calculate
    the optimal sample allocation that minimizes the variance of
    treatment effect under fixed budget, which is approximately the optimal
    sample allocation that maximizes statistical power under a fixed budget.
    The optimal design parameters include
    the level-1 sample size per level-2 unit (\code{n}),
    the level-2 sample size per level-3 unit (\code{J}),
    the level-3 sample size per level-4 unit (\code{K}),
    and the proportion of level-3 units to be assigned to treatment (\code{p}).
    This function solves the optimal \code{n}, \code{J}, \code{K} and/or \code{p}
    with and without constraints.
